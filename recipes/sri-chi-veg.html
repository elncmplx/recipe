        <strong>How to make the dish step-by-step</strong>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large oven-proof 
                <br />skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken skin-side 
                <br />down in the skillet; cook until browned, about 3 
                <br />minutes. Flip and cook until second side is browned, 
                <br />3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Drain excess 
                <br />grease if desired.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet. 
                <br />Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 
                <br />about 2 minutes. Stir in potatoes and red bell pepper; 
                <br />cook until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Place chicken 
                <br />thighs on top.</li>
            <li>Mix sriracha sauce and brown sugar together in a 
                <br />bowl; pour evenly over chicken.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read 
                <br />thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 165 
                <br />degrees F (74 degrees C) and potatoes are browned, 
                <br />about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
