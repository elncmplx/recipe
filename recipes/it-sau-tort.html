        <strong>How to make the dish step-by-step</strong>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat butter in a large, deep skillet over 
                medium heat. Cook and stir mushrooms, 1/2 
                cup white wine, and 1 clove minced garlic 
                until liquid has reduced and mushrooms have 
                softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from 
                heat and place in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat the same skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Cook and stir Italian sausage in the hot 
                skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 
                minutes, dividing it into bite-sized portions 
                while stirring. Remove excess grease by placing 
                paper towels onto a plate and dumping browned 
                sausage onto it to drain. Return sausage to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Return cooked mushrooms back to the skillet 
                with sausage and add tortellini, Alfredo basil 
                sauce, remaining 1/2 cup white wine, and remaining 
                garlic. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook, 
                stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes. Add 
                spinach; cover and cook until spinach is wilted, 
                3 to 4 minutes more. Mix well to combine. Remove 
                from heat and serve.</li>
        </ol>
