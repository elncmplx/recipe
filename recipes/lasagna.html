        <h4>by Elion</h4>

        <p><br />Elion was a dedicated chef that not only loved cooking, 
            <br />but he loved pussy as well. Through years of rigorous 
            <br />iterations of his recipe, he found that there were certain 
            <br />aspects to having a girl give you head on the first date. 
            <br />One of the key aspects was making them his world famous lasagna, 
            <br />hence known as: Make the girls pop they pussy lasagna.
        </p>

        <p><br />The lasagna not only brings out the best in his ability to 
            <br />cook but also his ability to get some game. The sweet, 
            <br />savory, and salty perfection of his recipe works not only
            <br />on women but on men as well (or so he had heard from others).

        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>

        <ul>
            <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage 
                <br />and lean ground beef.</li>
            <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are 
                <br />cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, 
                <br />two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness 
                <br />and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored 
                <br />with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian 
                <br />seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make 
                <br />this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze 
                <br />out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>How long to cook</strong>

        <p><br />The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook 
            <br />in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil 
            <br />for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for 
            <br />the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the lasagna 
            <br />rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut 
            <br />into it.
