                <div class="recipe-content">
                    <p>Elion was a dedicated chef that not only loved cooking, 
                        but he loved pussy as well. Through years of rigorous 
                        iterations of his recipe, he found that there were certain 
                        aspects to having a girl give you head on the first date. 
                        One of the key aspects was making them his world famous lasagna, 
                        hence known as: Make the girls pop they pussy lasagna.
                    </p>

                    <p>The lasagna not only brings out the best in his ability to 
                        cook but also his ability to get some game. The sweet, 
                        savory, and salty perfection of his recipe works not only
                        on women but on men as well (or so he had heard from others).

                    <strong>Ingredients:</strong>

                    <ul>

                            cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
                        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, 
                            two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
                        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness 
                            and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
                        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored 
                            with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian 
                            seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
                        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
                        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make

                        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze 
                            out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <strong>How long to cook</strong>

                    <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook 
                        in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil 
                        for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for 
                        the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the lasagna 
                        rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut 
                        into it.
